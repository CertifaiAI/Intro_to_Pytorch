    "The job of a data loader is to sample minibatches from a dataset, giving us the flexibility to choose the size of our minibatch to be use for training in each iteration. The constructor takes a `Dataset` object as input, along with `batch_size` and a `shuffle` boolean variable that indicates whether the data needs to be shuffled at the beginning of each epoch.\n",

    "In this chapter, we are going to do classification task based on Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST dataset could be directly imported and downloaded from `torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST`. Pytorch has collected several datasets (CIFAR, COCO, Cityscapes, etc..) in the `torchvision` library, you may have a look of the full list of datasets at [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html)."
